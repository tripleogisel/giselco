			<p class="question"> The Challenge</p>
			<p class="answer">iA Collaborative brought me in to look at several questions from FedEx designers about how to use the existing design language. The biggest challenges in the existing design language revolved around typography, button rationalization, responsiveness, visual hierarchy, and user messaging.</p>
			<p class="question"> My Role</p>
			<p class="answer"> As Senior UX Designer on this project I worked in lock-step with a graphic designer, group design lead, and account manager. I led daily design efforts to identify clear problem statements and outline solutions, managed project timelines, and delivered written guidelines and visual assets for the design language.</p>
			<p class="question"> Tools Used</p>
			<p class="answer">Keynote, Principle for Mac, Sketch</p>

		<p class="question">The Approach</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">We began work by understanding how the current design system did not meet the needs of designers and engineers at FedEx. FedEx handed over specific questions / complaints from their designers about where they felt the design language fell short.  In context of these considerations, we audited the existing dot-com experience to understand how these challenges manifested themselves in the product.</p>

		<p class="question">The biggest win</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">While many of the designers' complaints described very granular issues, our audit led us to uncovered an underlying structural problem. The guidelines had great typography and button rules, but didn't offer suggestions for how to combine elements to tell stories on a page. This resulted in pages that lacked a primary call to action. We developed a concept called the Narratives Framework address this structural challenge at scale. Page narratives maximize readability, vertical rhythm, and responsiveness across devices. Use page narratives as a template to organize pages into digestible story, including a single most important Main Narrative at the top.</p>
