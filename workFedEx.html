		<p class="question">The Challenge</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">iA collaborative has worked with FedEx as a design team and general consultant for over 10 years. In 2015, iA built a design language called "1DX" to support FedEx's design teams with a common source of truth when designing for fedex.com <br><br>In May 2018, iA asked me to help improve the FedEx Design Language. </p>

	<div class="processPart">
		<p class="question">The Approach</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">We began work by understanding how the current design system did not meet the needs of designers and engineers at FedEx. FedEx handed over specific questions / complaints from their designers about where they felt the design language fell short.  In context of these considerations, We audited the existing dot-com experience to understand how these challenges manifested themselves in the product. </p>

	<div class="processPart">
		<p class="question">The biggest win</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">While many of the designers' complaints described very granular issues, our audit led us to uncovered an underlying structural problem. The guidelines had great typography and button rules, but didn't offer suggestions for how to combine elements to tell stories on a page. This resulted in pages that lacked a primary call to action. We developed a concept called the Narratives Framework address this structural challenge at scale. Page narratives maximize readability, vertical rhythm, and responsiveness across devices. Use page narratives as a template to organize pages into digestible story, including a single most important Main Narrative at the top.</p>
