			<!-- <p class="question"> The Challenge</p>
			<p class="answer">My Bichu came to us with Sketch files "almost done" after struggling with a handoff to a contracted engineer. After a few long conversations about the work to-date, it became clear that previous design work had produced sexy visuals but lacked thoughtfulness around the product architecture and how it works. This lack of user experience design made it difficult for engineers to build with confidence, and we convinced Bichu to start work "from scratch" with us.</p> -->
			<p class="question"> My Role</p>
			<p class="answer"> As head of design on this project I led and executed every aspect of the end-to-end design process. So far we have develoepd a detailed UX navigation map, annotated wireframes, and a working prototype for our upcoming user tests.
			<p class="question"> Tools Used</p>
			<p class="answer">Axure, Lookback.io, Principle for Mac, Sketch</p>

		<p class="question">The Approach</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">In a kickoff joint working session with the founder, we tabled all solution-related design worked and dove deep into the product vision and understanding its users. We developed user personas, worked on a "first tweet", and then revisited our personas to see if our first tweet would appeal to our expected power users. <br><br> We came up with "Everyone is a stylist – build brand new outfits to shop and share with the world" as a first tweet. This mission statement provided us with a razor for user-centered decision making throughout the design process.</p>

		<p class="question">iA and Wireframes</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">We work on content organization and visual design separately as often as possible. This allows us to narrow our focus and work more efficiently. Now with a solid understanding of our user needs and client goals, we began to map out possible solutions for how to best navigate through games, tickets, and ticket management. Once we believed in our iA map, we organized the content per view and designed formal wireframes.</p>

	<div class="processPart">
		<p class="question">User testing</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">We put these ideas in front of real users to validate our new iA patterns. To move quickly, we validated the iA while simultaneously iterating on potential visual design patterns. We ended up with 2 primary prototypes. Our test consisted of 7 real Notre Dame Season Ticket Members in an A/B counterbalanced format. We recorded qualitative feedback relating to overal impressions, ease of use and general preferwences. We also measured qualitative metrics based on success/failure of designated user tasks and mapped these to produce 95% confidence intervals.</p>

		<p class="question">Visual Design</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">User testing validated our new iA patterns and empowered us to move quickly to visual design. We develop pattern-based atomic design systems to ensure efficient design and development and scalability. We begin this process with a Ui system map that describes how the different components of this product behave and interact. This system map provides the entire team with an internal vocabulary – our engineers absolutely loved this resource. <br><br>Next, we determined the fonts and colors that made up the beginnings of our atomic design system. This adds more words to our internal vocabulary and speciifes all of the possible font styles in the product.<br><br>Last, we applied this structure and finalized the visual design to meet Notre Dame Athletics Brand Guidelines. This last effort included pixel-perfect mockups of all of the key screens used both internally and for marketing purposes.</p>

		<p class="question">conclusion</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">Our final solution provided Notre Dame Season Ticket Members with the most streamlined ticketing experience on a mobile device. We prioritized games, tickets, and ticket management. It accomodated the vast spectrum of fans by making it easy to both scan tickets at the game and share tickets with friends. A few weeks after the initial launch, we seamlessly deployed a pattern we planned for to change sports. We also developed a reusable carousel Ui structure that encouraged users to have immediate positive interactions with the product.</p>
