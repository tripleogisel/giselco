			<p class="question"> Project Overview</p>
			<p class="answer">Acquired by Cox Enterprises in 2014, Experience (ExpApp) provides commerce, ticket sales, and data software solutions for over 350 sports teams and entertainment venues. For fans using the platform, it allows them to personalize every live event with exclusive merchandise, VIP experiences and flexible tickets.</p>
			<p class="question"> My Role</p>
			<p class="answer"> As a UX/Ui designer, I worked in partnership with another UX Designer to produce the various deliverables and artifacts seen below.</p>
			<p class="question"> The Challenge</p>
			<p class="answer">Post-acquisition, Experience was ready to push its platform to another level. The ux and general visual design had not been hollistically updated since the company was founded in 2011. We were challenged to improve the overal user experience in a scalable way, overhaul the visual design and brand, showcase the breadth of offers available for every event, and increase user engagement between gamedays.</p>

		<p class="question">The Approach</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">In order to best understand the current state of the product we performed a total UX audit. We analyzed our user's main motivations and pain points by collecting support tickets and combing through historical survey data. <br><br> Next, we physically printed app screens and taped them to the wall to fully understand the interconnected user flows – giving us a physical space to discuss possible changes to the overall UX or Ui. We combined this with a visual See | Do map to provide a crystal clear understanding of the current product design architecture. Finally, we identified core screens as "user flow milestones" and practiced a content hierarchy card-sort exercise to prioritize the content on those screens.</p>

		<p class="question">Design Sprints and iA</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">With our solid understanding of the current product, user needs, and company goals, we recruited fellow employees to help brainstorm solutions to improve the nature of our product. We adapted the Google Ventures Design Sprint methodology into a "Rapid Design Sprint" format. We led several of these cross-functional 2 hour Rapid Design Sprints to broaden our understanding of both user and business goals. <br><br> Based on the results of the sprints we then set out to map the iA for our new vision. Our new architecture focused on prioritized a new home location to help orient users.</p>

		<p class="question">User tests</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">We put these ideas in front of real users to validate our new iA patterns. To move quickly, we validated the iA while simultaneously iterating on potential visual design patterns. We ended up with 2 primary prototypes. Our test consisted of 10 real customers in an A/B/C counterbalanced format. We recorded qualitative feedback relating to overal impressions, ease of use and general preferwences. We also measured qualitative metrics based on success/failure of designated user tasks and mapped these to produce 95% confidence intervals.</p>

		<p class="question">Visual design</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">We created a modular and reusable design system consisting of common Ui elements that built up into consistent UX patterns to ensure the platform scaled.</p>

		<p class="question">conclusion</p>
		<p class="answer caseAnswer">Our final solution focused on a UX model of gradual engagement. We display product offeringds in a more natural way – "Already have a ticket? Great! Check out these other offers for that game". The UX model also revolved around a fan home that served as a launchpad for users to customize and manage their events.</p>
